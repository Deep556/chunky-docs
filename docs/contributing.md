How to Contribute
=================

The simplest way to help with the development of Chunky is to report any issues
you may come accross on the [Chunky issue tracker][1]. If you do have a bug to
report or a feature to request, please do a quick search on the issue tracker
first to see if your issue has already been reported.

<a name="documentation"></a>Editing the Documentation
------------------------------------------------------

Another great way to contribute is to update the documentation pages.

The Chunky documentation is managed in a [separate GitHub project][2]. It is
easy to propose changes to the documentation if you have a GitHub account.
Simply locate the file you wish to edit and click the ["Edit" button in the
GitHub interface][3]. When you are satisfied with the changes you will be able
to submit a ["pull request"][4]. If all is well your changes will soon be
incorporated into the official documentation.
