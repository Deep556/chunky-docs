##Skymaps

You can change the skymap under the "Sky" tab of the Render Controls dialog.
You can also change the sun position relative to the skymap.

Chunky currently only accepts skymaps using equirectangular projection with 90
degree vertical field of view (clamped at horizon).

It is recommended to use a large skymap in order to avoid the sky looking
blurry.  However, if the skymap is too large it will take a long time to load.
