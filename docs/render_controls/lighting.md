|Enable Emitters    | Toggles light emission from emitters. Turning emitters off will not remove them from the world but instead render them as other objects. This means that objects usually emitting light will now let the path continue bouncing rather than terminating it. Example of Emitter Effects. |
|Emitter Intensity  | Controls the intensity of emitters. Moving the slider to the far left will cause emitters to radiate very little light and values further to the right will have the opposite effect. |
