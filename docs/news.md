##2014-06-19 New Website

The Chunky Wiki has been replaced by a more static site, the one you are
currently viewing.

The Wiki has been running for about two years now, but due to the high
frequency of spam bots signing up to make spam edits I had to restrict access
so that unauthorized users could not make any changes, however that defeated
the original purpose of the Wiki.

I hope that this new site will serve the users better. It is still possible to
edit pages on here, only now you will have to go through the GitHub process to
submit requested changes.

Thank you everyone who edited the Wiki! Some of the Wiki pages have been moved
over to this new site by TheRenderJunkie and myself.
